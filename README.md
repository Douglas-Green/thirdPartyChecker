This is my attempt at making a web app that would ultimately take a search query of some third party software someone may have installed on their system and return a detailed response on whether or not that software has known vulnerabilities that need to be patched. This way people have a consolidated resources to reach out to many different web sources to retrieve that information. This is a passion project for me and I am still learning Javascript so please keep that in mind.

** ALWAYS open to feedback and suggestions
-Just rememeber my statement above I'm still a beginner in the field.
